# application-form

This library contains the UI for rendering application forms. It has built in support for a multi-step form experience, progress indicators, field rendering, custom field rendering, storing answers, and more.

## Technology

This library uses [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for providing form validation, and general performance improvements.

## How to create a new field

First, follow the steps listed in the README for application-template for creating a new field. Then create a new file and add it to `src/components/fields/**` and make sure it is exported from `src/components/fields/index.ts`.

If the field should update some state in the form (such as store answers by the user), it needs to have components that are wrapped in react-hook-form's `Controller` component, or inputs that are `register`-ed to the react-hook-form. An example of these can be viewed in `src/components/fields/custom/ExampleCountryField.tsx`.
