This repository is the center of development for digital government
services on `island.is`. It is managed by the [Digital Iceland] department
inside the [Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs].

These solutions are [FOSS] and open to contributions, but most development
is performed by teams that win tenders to develop new functionality for
Digital Iceland.

## How to contribute

We are working on documentation and workflows to help external developers understand and run these solutions locally.

For now, we appreciate assistance with security reviews (more eyes = better), documentation and smaller fixes.

## Repository structure

The repository is a [monorepo](https://github.com/island-is/handbook/blob/master/monorepo.md) that has multiple apps (something that can be built and run) and libraries (which other apps and libraries can depend on).

Our system architecture generally includes frontend projects, a graphql API gateway, and service APIs. Many of these projects are in early development.

Featured projects:

- [Island.is website](./apps/web)
- [Application system](./apps/application-system)
- [Service Portal](./apps/service-portal)
- [Shared GraphQL API](./apps/api)
- [Island UI design system](./libs/island-ui)

Other projects:

- [Digital Judicial System](./apps/judicial-system)
- [Travel Gift](./apps/gjafakort)
- [Air Discount Scheme](./apps/air-discount-scheme)
- [COVID Activities](./apps/adgerdir)

## Working in the monorepo

### Development server

Run `yarn start <project>` for a dev server. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `yarn build <project>` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `yarn test <project>` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `yarn affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `yarn e2e <project>-e2e` to execute end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `yarn affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

### Generate a component

Run `yarn generate @nrwl/react:component MyComponent --project=island-ui-core` to generate a new component in island-ui-core.

### Generate an application

Run `yarn generate @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate a simple React application.

To get a React application with server-side-rendering, we recommend using Next.JS: `yarn generate @nrwl/next:app my-app`

To create a service, you can get started with NestJS like this: `yarn generate @nrwl/nest:app services/my-service`

### Generate a library

Run `yarn generate @nrwl/react:lib my-lib --linter eslint` to generate a React library.

To create a NestJS module: `yarn generate @nrwl/node:lib my-lib`

To create a JS library that can be used both on the frontend and the backend: `yarn generate @nrwl/node:lib my-lib`

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@island.is/my-lib`.

Applications and libraries can be structured in a hierarchy using subfolders:

```
yarn generate @nrwl/node:lib common/my-lib

# Imported from '@island.is/common/my-lib'
```

### Migrations

Using the `sequelize-cli` we support version controlled migrations that keep track of changes to the database.

#### Generate a migrations

Run `yarn nx run <project>:migrate/generate`

#### Migrating

Run `yarn nx run <project>:migrate`

### Generate schema and client types

All api calls should be type checked to backend schemas. When you update an API, you may need to generate schema files:

```
yarn nx run <project>:generate-schema
```

And generate client types that depend on the schema:

```
yarn nx run <project>:codegen
```

### Understand your workspace

Run `yarn nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

### Fetch development secrets for your project

Run `yarn env-secrets <project> [options]`

**Example**:

```
yarn env-secrets gjafakort --reset
```
